      <p>
        The cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal. With acceleration that
        would leave most automobiles in the dust, a cheetah can go from 0 to
        60 miles an hour in only three seconds. These big cats are quite
        nimble at high speed and can make quick and sudden turns in pursuit of
        prey.
